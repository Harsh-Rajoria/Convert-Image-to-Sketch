# Convert-Image-to-Sketch

Convert Color Image to Sketch using Python

This project focuses on converting a color image into a pencil sketch using Python and OpenCV. It involves reading an image, converting it to grayscale, inverting the grayscale image, applying a Gaussian blur to the inverted image, and then blending the grayscale image with the blurred version using a dodge blend technique. The result is a sketch-like representation of the original color image.
